What is clustering?

Clustering is  a process of dividing the dataset into groups , consisting of similar data-points.
:-Points in the same group are as similar as possible.
:-Points in different ogroup are as dissimilar as possible.

example of clustering:- group of diners in  restaurant

                        (the data point in one cluster entirly different from the datapoint the other clustr
                        all the points in a same cluster are either same or related to each other)
                        
                        Items aranged in a mall

Types of clustering:
            Exclusive Clustering
            Overlapping Clustering
            Hierarchical Clustering
            
            Exclusive Clustering :-
                      Hard Clustring
                      Data Point / Item belongs exclusively to one Cluster
                      For Example :- K-means Clustering
           
           Overlapping Clustering:-
                      Soft Cluster
                      Data Point / Item Belongs to multiple cluster
                      For example :- Fuzzy / C-Means Clustering
          
          
          Hierarchical Clustering:-ex:-tendogram
                      
                      
                      
                      
  K means Clustering:-
            "K-means is a clustering algorithim whose main goal is to group similar elements or data
            points into a cluster.
            "
