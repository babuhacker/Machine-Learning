types of learning:
1)Supervised Learning
2)Reinforcement Learning
3)Unsupervised Learning

1)Supervised Learning:-  Supervised Learning is where you have i/p varaibles(x) and an output varaible(Y) and you use an algorithm 
                        to learn the mapping funtion from the input to the output.
                        data you hava already contain classification;
                        ex : we knew that if you hava this width and this length of the sepal length and petal length so taht be the species of the flower.
example:- KNN,logistic regression , decision tree

                 works:- Training data-------learning algorithm-----create Model------test Data ------- accuracy(actual o/p - the o/p which is present in the test daata)
                 
                 
 
 2)Unsupervised Learning:- Unsupervised learning is the training of a model using information that is nither classified nor labelled.
                          This model can be used to cluster the input data in classes on the basis of their statistical properties
                          
                          
                                    :-class-1:-:
                          Data------:          :--  High intra class simlarity | low inter class simlarity
                                    :-class-2:-:
                                    

Algorithm example:- K-means clustering






3)Reinforcement Learning:-Reinforcement is learning by interacting with a space or an enviroment.
                          An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions,rather than from being taught explicitly.
                          it selects its actions on basis of its past experiences and also by new choices.

                    :--------------:Environment----:
