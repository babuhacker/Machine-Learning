Difference between clasification and Regression problem:
Classification:-
	Classification is the task of predicting a dscrete class label.
	In a classification problem data is classified into one of two or more classes
	A classification problem with two classes is called binary.
	more than two classes is called multi-class classification.
	like classifiy the mail:
	      :--spam
	mail:-:
	      :--Non-spam
		
	Predict a continous value ,this continous value actually reprsennt the  probability of a given data point
	belongin to a each output class.
	Always the N result in classification problem is going to be label or class
Regression:-
	Regression is the task of predicting a continous quantity.
	A continous  quantity is basically  continous varaible is varaible infinte no. of possiblities.
	
	Regression is a predictive analysis used to predict  continous varaibles.
	

What is Regression?

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modeling technique whcih investigates
the relationship between a dependent and independent varaible.
(A regression analysis envloves graphing a line over a set of datapoint that most cloesly
fits the overall shap of the data.)
uses of regression:
	Determining the strength of predictors.
	Forecasting an effect,and
	Trend forecasting

What is linear regression?
Linear regressio is a method to predict dependent varaible(Y) based on values of independent varaible(X).
it can be used for the cases where we want to predict some contionous quantitiy.
foe example: predict stock price:
				Dependent varaible :Stock price(always continous) 
				Independent varaible :Time(it can be continous and it can be descrete)

Working of linear regression:-
	First of all we are trying to figure out the relationship between dependent variable 
	and indepedent variable by using a best fitting straight line.
	
	both two varaible various linearly respect to each other .
	
	Y = b0+b1x+e;
	|    | | | |__________Error			    
	|    | | |
	|    | | |________________Independent Variable
	|    | |		
	|    | |__________Slope
	|    |
	|    |__________________Y intercept
     Dependent variable
     
     
     
     
     Y= mX+C
     
     
     Logistic Regression:=-
     
     Logistic Regression is basic and popular algoritthm to solve the classification problem.
     
     Logistic Regression is a method used to predict a dependent variable, given a set of independent
     variable, such that the dependent variable is categorical.
     
     Categorical variable basically binary type of variable.hold values linke yes/no or 1/0
     
     Sigmoid funtion
